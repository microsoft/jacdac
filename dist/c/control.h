 * `service_class` indicates class identifier for each service index (service index `0` is always control, so it's
 * skipped in this enumeration).
 * `packet_count` indicates the number of packets sent by the current device since last announce,
 * including the current announce packet (it is always 0 if this feature is not supported).
 * The command form can be used to induce report, which is otherwise broadcast every 500ms.

 * The transition will complete in about `512 / speed` frames
 * (each frame is currently 100ms, so speed of `51` is about 1 second and `26` 0.5 second).
 * As a special case, if speed is `0` the transition is immediate.
 * If MCU is not capable of executing transitions, it can consider `speed` to be always `0`.
 * If a monochrome LEDs is fitted, the average value of ``red``, ``green``, ``blue`` is used.
 * If intensity of a monochrome LED cannot be controlled, any value larger than `0` should be considered
 * on, and `0` (for all three channels) should be considered off.
