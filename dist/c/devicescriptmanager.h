 * Argument: bytecode_size B uint32_t. Open pipe for streaming in the bytecode of the program. The size of the bytecode has to be declared upfront.
 * To clear the program, use `bytecode_size == 0`.
 * The bytecode is streamed over regular pipe data packets.
 * The bytecode shall be fully written into flash upon closing the pipe.
 * If `autostart` is true, the program will start after being deployed.
 * The data payloads, including the last one, should have a size that is a multiple of 32 bytes.
 * Thus, the initial bytecode_size also needs to be a multiple of 32.

 * The counter starts at `0`, increments by `1` for each packet and wraps around.
 * It can be used to detect if some messages are missing.
 * If message is too long to fit in a single packet, it will be fragmented (this is not implemented yet).
 * In a fragmented message, all packets except for the last one have `ToBeContinued` flag set.
 * Note that `counter` field will increase in each fragment.
 * `log_message` reports are only sent when `logging == true`.
