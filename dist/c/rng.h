/**
 * Constant Variant (uint8_t). The type of algorithm/technique used to generate the number.
 * `Quantum` refers to dedicated hardware device generating random noise due to quantum effects.
 * `ADCNoise` is the noise from quick readings of analog-digital converter, which reads temperature of the MCU or some floating pin.
 * `WebCrypto` refers is used in simulators, where the source of randomness comes from an advanced operating system.
