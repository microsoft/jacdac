    "comment": "## Light programs\n\nRealistically, with 1 mbit JACDAC, we can transmit under 2k of data per animation frame (at 20fps).\nIf transmitting raw data that would be around 500 pixels, which is not enough for many\ninstallations and it would completely clog the network.\n\nThus, light service defines a domain-specific language for describing light animations\nand efficiently transmitting them over wire.\n\nLight commands are not JACDAC commands.\nLight commands are efficiently encoded as sequences of bytes and typically sent as payload\nof `run` command.\n\nDefinitions:\n* `P` - position in the strip\n* `R` - number of repetitions of the command\n* `N` - number of pixels affected by the command\n* `C` - single color designation\n* `C+` - sequence of color designations\n\nUpdate modes:\n* `0` - replace\n* `1` - add RGB\n* `2` - subtract RGB\n* `3` - multiply RGB (by c/128); each pixel value will change by at least 1\n\nProgram commands:\n* `0xD0: set_all(C+)` - set all pixels in current range to given color pattern\n* `0xD1: fade(C+)` - set pixels in current range to colors between colors in sequence\n* `0xD2: fade_hsv(C+)` - similar to `fade()`, but colors are specified and faded in HSV\n* `0xD3: rotate_fwd(K)` - rotate (shift) pixels by `K` positions away from the connector\n* `0xD4: rotate_back(K)` - same, but towards the connector\n* `0xD5: show(M=50)` - send buffer to strip and wait `M` milliseconds\n* `0xD6: range(P=0, N=length, W=1, S=0)` - range from pixel `P`, `N` pixels long\n  (currently unsupported: every `W` pixels skip `S` pixels)\n* `0xD7: mode(K=0)` - set update mode\n* `0xD8: mode1(K=0)` - set update mode for next command only\n* `0xCF: set1(P, C)` - set one pixel at `P` (in current range) to given color\n\nA number `k` is encoded as follows:\n* `0 <= k < 128` -> `k`\n* `128 <= k < 16383` -> `0x80 | (k >> 8), k & 0xff`\n* bigger and negative numbers are not supported\n\nThus, bytes `0xC0-0xFF` are free to use for commands.\n\nFormats:\n* `0xC1, R, G, B` - single color parameter\n* `0xC2, R0, G0, B0, R1, G1, B1` - two color parameter\n* `0xC3, R0, G0, B0, R1, G1, B1, R2, G2, B2` - three color parameter\n* `0xC0, N, R0, G0, B0, ..., R(N-1), G(N-1), B(N-1)` - `N` color parameter\n* `0xCF, <number>, R, G, B` - `set1` special format\n\nCommands are encoded as command byte, followed by parameters in the order\nfrom the command definition.\n\nThe `set1()` command has irregular encoding to save space - it is byte `0xCF` followed by encoded\nnumber, and followed by 3 bytes of color.",
