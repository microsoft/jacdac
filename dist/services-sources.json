transmit under 2k of data per animation frame (at 20fps).\nIf transmitting raw data that would be around 500 pixels, which is not enough for many\ninstallations and it would completely clog the network.\n\nThus, light service defines a domain-specific language for describing light animations\nand efficiently transmitting them over wire.\n\nLight commands are not Jacdac commands.\nLight commands are efficiently encoded as sequences of bytes and typically sent as payload\nof `run` command.\n\nDefinitions:\n* `P` - position in the strip\n* `R` - number of repetitions of the command\n* `N` - number of pixels affected by the command\n* `C` - single color designation\n* `C+` - sequence of color designations\n\nUpdate modes:\n* `0` - replace\n* `1` - add RGB\n* `2` - subtract RGB\n* `3` - multiply RGB (by c/128); each pixel value will change by at least 1\n\nProgram commands:\n* `0xD0: setall C+` - set all pixels in current range to given color pattern\n* `0xD1: fade C+` - set pixels in current range to colors between colors in sequence\n* `0xD2: fadehsv C+` - similar to `fade()`, but colors are specified and faded in HSV\n* `0xD3: rotfwd K` - rotate (shift) pixels by `K` positions away from the connector\n* `0xD4: rotback K` - same, but towards the connector\n* `0xD5: show M=50` - send buffer to strip and wait `M` milliseconds\n* `0xD6: range P=0 N=length W=1 S=0` - range from pixel `P`, `N` pixels long\n  (currently unsupported: every `W` pixels skip `S` pixels)\n* `0xD7: mode K=0` - set update mode\n* `0xD8: tmpmode K=0` - set update mode for next command only\n* `0xCF: setone P C` - set one pixel at `P` (in current range) to given color\n* `mult V` - macro to multiply current range by given value (float)\n\nA number `k` is encoded as follows:\n* `0 <= k < 128` -> `k`\n* `128 <= k < 16383` -> `0x80 | (k >> 8), k & 0xff`\n* bigger and negative numbers are not supported\n\nThus, bytes `0xC0-0xFF` are free to use for commands.\n\nFormats:\n* `0xC1, R, G, B` - single color parameter\n* `0xC2, R0, G0, B0, R1, G1, B1` - two color parameter\n* `0xC3, R0, G0, B0, R1, G1, B1, R2, G2, B2` - three color parameter\n* `0xC0, N, R0, G0, B0, ..., R(N-1), G(N-1), B(N-1)` - `N` color parameter\n* `0xCF, <number>, R, G, B` - `set1` special format\n\nCommands are encoded as command byte, followed by parameters in the order\nfrom the command definition.\n\nThe `setone()` command has irregular encoding to save space - it is byte `0xCF` followed by encoded\nnumber, and followed by 3 bytes of color.\n\n## Registers\n\n    rw brightness =

first few packets can be even sent more often)\n* If an enabled power service sees a `shutdown` command from somebody else,\n  it disables itself (unless in grace period)\n* If a disabled power service sees no `shutdown` command for more than ~1200ms, it enables itself\n  (this is when the previous power source is unplugged or otherwise malfunctions)\n* If a power service has been disabled for around 10s, it enables itself.\n\nAdditionally:\n* While the `allowed` register is set to `0`, the service will not enable itself (nor send `shutdown` commands)\n* When a current overdraw is detected, the service stop providing power and enters `Overload` state for around 2 seconds,\n  while still sending `shutdown` commands.\n\n### Client notes\n\nIf a client hears a `shutdown` command it just means it's on a branch of the\nnetwork with a (high) power provider.\nAs clients (brains) typically do not consume much current (as opposed to, say, servos),\nthe `shutdown` commands are typically irrelevant to them.\n\nFor power monitoring, the `power_status_changed` event (and possibly `power_status` register)\ncan be used.\nIn particular, user interfaces may alert the user to `Overload` status.\nThe `Overprovision` status is generally considered normal (eg. when two multi-channel power providers are linked together).\n\n### Server implementation notes\n\n#### An MCU per channel\n\nEvery channel has:\n* a cheap 8-bit MCU (eg., PMS150C)\n* a current limiter with latching circuit\n* an analog switch\n\nThe MCU is connected to data line of the channel.\nThe switch joins the data line of the channel with internal data bus, common to all channels.\nBoth the switch and the limiter are controlled by the MCU.\nThe latching circuit on the limiter shuts it down immediately on current overdraw.\n\nDuring reception, after the beginning of `shutdown` frame is detected,\nthe switch is opened for a brief period.\nIf the `shutdown` frame is received correctly, it means it was on MCU's channel.\n\n#### A dedicated MCU for multiple channels\n\nEvery channel has:\n* a current limiter with latching circuit\n* an analog switch\n* a wiggle-detection line connecting the MCU to data line of the channel\n\nThe MCU here needs at least 4 pins per channel.\nSwitches and limiters are set up like in the configuration above.\nThe Jacdac data line of the MCU is connected to internal data bus.\n\nWhile a Jacdac packet is being received, the MCU keeps checking if it is a \nbeginning of the `shutdown` frame.\nIf that is the case, it opens all switches and checks which one(s) of the channel\ndata lines wiggle (via the wiggle lines; this can be done with EXTI latches).\nThe one(s) that wiggle received the `shutdown` frame and need to be disabled.\n\nAlso, while sending the `shutdown` frames itself, it needs to be done separately\nfor each channel, with all the other switches open.\nIf during that operation we detect wiggle on other channels, then we have detected\na loop, and the respective channels needs to be disabled.\n\n#### A brain-integrated power supply\n\nHere, there's only one channel of power and we don't have hard real time requirements,\nso user-programmable brain can control it.\nThere is no need for analog switch or wiggle-detection line,\nbut the current limiter with latching circuit is still needed.\n\nThere is nothing special to do during reception of `shutdown` packet.\nWhen it is received, the current limiter should just be disabled.\n\nIdeally, exception/hard-fault handlers on the MCU should also disable the\ncurrent limiter.\nSimilarly, the limiter should be disabled while the MCU is in bootloader mode,\nor otherwise unaware of the power negotiation protocol. \n\n### Rationale for the grace period\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\n* device A queues `shutdown` command for sending\n* A receives external `shutdown` packet from B (thus disabling A)\n* the A `shutdown` command is sent from the queue (thus eventually disabling B)\n\nTo avoid that, we make sure that at the precise instant when `shutdown` command is sent,\nthe power is enabled (and thus will stay enabled until another `shutdown` command arrives).\nThis could be achieved by inspecting the enable bit, aftering acquiring the line\nand before starting UART transmission, however that would require breaking abstraction layers.\nSo instead, we never disable the service, while the `shutdown` packet is queued.\nThis may lead to delays in disabling power services, but these should be limited due to the\nrandom nature of the `shutdown` packet spacing.\n\n### Rationale for timings\n\nThe initial 0-300ms delay is set to spread out the `shutdown` periods of power services,\nto minimize collisions.\nThe `shutdown` periods are randomized 400-600ms, instead of a fixed 500ms used for regular\nservices, for the same reason.\n\nThe 1200ms period is set so that droping two `shutdown` packets in a row\nfrom the current provider will not cause power switch, while missing 3 will.\n\nThe 50-60s power switch period is arbitrary, but chosen to limit amount of switching between supplies,\nwhile keeping it short enough for user to notice any problems such switching may cause.\n\n## Registers\n\n    rw allowed = 1: bool @ intensity\n\nCan be used to completely disable the service.\nWhen allowed, the service may still not be providing power, see \n`power_status` for the actual current state.\n\n    rw max_power? = 900: u16 mA {typical_max = 900} @ max_power\n\nLimit the power provided by the service.
