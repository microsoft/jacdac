first few announce packets can be even sent more often)\n* If an enabled power service sees a power `active` report from somebody else of higher or equal priority,\n  it disables itself (unless in grace period)\n* If a disabled power service sees no power `active` report for more than ~1200ms, it enables itself\n  (this is when the previous power source is unplugged or otherwise malfunctions)\n* Power services keep track of the current provider\n  (device ID from the most recent `active` report, either incoming or outgoing).\n  If the current provider has not changed for at least 50-60s (random),\n  and its last priority is lower or equal to the current service priority,\n  then just before the next announce period, the service enables itself\n  (thus also resetting the 50-60s timer).\n\n### Rationale for the grace period\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n* device A queues `active` report for sending\n* A receives external `active` packet from B (thus disabling A)\n* the A `active` report is sent from the queue (thus eventually disabling B)\nTo avoid that, we make sure that at the precise instant when `active` report is sent,\nthe device is enabled (and thus will stay enabled until another `active` report arrives).\nThis could be achieved by inspecting the enable bit, aftering acquiring the line\nand before starting UART transmission, however that would require breaking abstraction layers.\nSo instead, we never disable the service, while the `active` packet is queued.\nThis may lead to delays in disabling power services, but these should be limited due to the\nrandom nature of the announce packet spacing.\n\n### Rationale for timings\n\nThe initial 0-300ms delay is set to spread out the announce periods of power services,\nto minimize collisions.\nThe announce periods are randomized 400-600ms, instead of a fixed 500ms used for regular\nservices, for the same reason.\n\nThe 1200ms period is set so that droping two announce packets in a row\nfrom the current provider will not cause power switch, while missing 3 will.\n\nThe 50-60s power switch period is arbitrary, but chosen to limit amount of switching between supplies,\nwhile keeping it short enough for user to notice any problems such switching may cause."},"classIdentifier":530893146,"enums":{},"packets":[{"kind":"const","name":"instance_name","identifier":265,"description":"A friendly name that describes the role of this service instance in the device.\nIt often corresponds to what's printed on the device:\nfor example, `A` for button A, or `S0` for servo channel 0.\nWords like `left` should be avoided because of localization issues (unless they are printed on the device).","fields":[{"name":"_","unit":"","type":"string","storage":0}],"optional":true,"identifierName":"instance_name","packFormat":"s","derived":"_base"},{"kind":"ro","name":"status_code","identifier":259,"description":"Reports the current state or error status of the device. ``code`` is a standardized value from \nthe Jacdac status/error codes. ``vendor_code`` is any vendor specific error code describing the device\nstate.
