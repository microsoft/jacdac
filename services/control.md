# Control

    identifier: 0x00000000
    tags: C, 8bit

Control service is always service index `0`.
It handles actions common to all services on a device.

Note: some of the optional features (including `flood_ping`, `mcu_temperature`, and all string registers)
are not implemented in `8bit` version.

## Commands

    flags AnnounceFlags : u16 {
        RestartCounterSteady =  0x000F,
        RestartCounter1 =       0x0001,
        RestartCounter2 =       0x0002,
        RestartCounter4 =       0x0004,
        RestartCounter8 =       0x0008,
        StatusLightNone =       0x0000,
        StatusLightMono =       0x0010,
        StatusLightRgbNoFade =  0x0020,
        StatusLightRgbFade =    0x0030,
        SupportsACK =           0x0100,
        SupportsBroadcast =     0x0200,
        SupportsFrames =        0x0400,
        IsClient =              0x0800,
    }
    command services @ announce { }
    report {
        flags: AnnounceFlags
        packet_count: u8
        reserved: u8
    repeats:
        service_class: u32
    }

The `restart_counter` is computed from the `flags & RestartCounterSteady`, starts at `0x1` and increments by one until it reaches `0xf`, then it stays at `0xf`.
If this number ever goes down, it indicates that the device restarted.
`service_class` indicates class identifier for each service index (service index `0` is always control, so it's
skipped in this enumeration).
`packet_count` indicates the number of packets sent by the current device since last announce,
including the current announce packet (it is always 0 if this feature is not supported).
The command form can be used to induce report, which is otherwise broadcast every 500ms.

    command noop @ 0x80 { }

Do nothing. Always ignored. Can be used to test ACKs.

    command identify? @ 0x81 { }

Blink the status LED (262ms on, 262ms off, four times, with the blue LED) or otherwise draw user's attention to device with no status light. 
For devices with status light (this can be discovered in the announce flags), the client should
send the sequence of status light command to generate the identify animation.

    command reset? @ 0x82 { }

Reset device. ACK may or may not be sent.

    command flood_ping? @ 0x83 {
        num_responses: u32
        start_counter: u32
        size: u8 B
    }
    report {
        counter: u32
        dummy_payload: bytes
    }

The device will respond `num_responses` times, as fast as it can, setting the `counter` field in the report
to `start_counter`, then `start_counter + 1`, ..., and finally `start_counter + num_responses - 1`.
The `dummy_payload` is `size` bytes long and contains bytes `0, 1, 2, ...`.

    command set_status_light @ 0x84 {
        to_red: u8
        to_green: u8
        to_blue: u8
        speed: u8
    }

Initiates a color transition of the status light from its current color to the one specified.
The transition will complete in about `512 / speed` frames
(each frame is currently 100ms, so speed of `51` is about 1 second and `26` 0.5 second).
As a special case, if speed is `0` the transition is immediate.
If MCU is not capable of executing transitions, it can consider `speed` to be always `0`.
If a monochrome LEDs is fitted, the average value of ``red``, ``green``, ``blue`` is used.
If intensity of a monochrome LED cannot be controlled, any value larger than `0` should be considered
on, and `0` (for all three channels) should be considered off.

## Registers

    rw reset_in? : u32 us @ 0x80

When set to value other than `0`, it asks the device to reset after specified number of microseconds.
This is typically used to implement watchdog functionality, where a brain device sets `reset_in` to
say 1.6s every 0.5s.

    const device_description?: string @ 0x180

Identifies the type of hardware (eg., ACME Corp. Servo X-42 Rev C)

    const firmware_identifier? : u32 { absolute_min = 0x3000_0000, absolute_max = 0x3fff_ffff } @ 0x181

A numeric code for the string above; used to identify firmware images and devices.

    const bootloader_firmware_identifier?: u32 { absolute_min = 0x3000_0000, absolute_max = 0x3fff_ffff } @ 0x184

Typically the same as `firmware_identifier` unless device was flashed by hand; the bootloader will respond to that code.

    const firmware_version?: string @ 0x185

A string describing firmware version; typically semver.

    ro mcu_temperature?: i16 Â°C { preferred_interval=60000, typical_min = -10, typical_max = 150 } @ 0x182

MCU temperature in degrees Celsius (approximate).

    ro uptime?: u64 us { preferred_interval=60000 } @ 0x186

Number of microseconds since boot.

    const device_url?: string @ 0x187

Request the information web site for this device

    const device_specification_url?: string @ 0x189

URL pointing to device JSON specification.

    const firmware_url?: string @ 0x188

URL with machine-readable metadata information about updating device firmware
