        x: i1.15 /
        y: i1.15 /
    }

If the joystick is analog, the directional buttons should be "simulated", based on joystick position
(`Left` is `{ x = -1, y = 0 }`, `Up` is `{ x = 0, y = -1}`).
If the joystick is digital, then each direction will read as either `-1`, `0`, or `1` (in fixed representation).
The primary button on the joystick is `A`.

    enum Variant : u8 {
        Thumb = 1
        ArcadeBall = 2
        ArcadeStick = 3
        Gamepad = 4
    }
    const variant?: Variant @ variant

The type of physical joystick.

    const buttons_available: Buttons @ 0x180

Indicates a bitmask of the buttons that are mounted on the joystick.
If the `Left`/`Up`/`Right`/`Down` buttons are marked as available here, the joystick is digital.
Even when marked as not available, they will still be simulated based on the analog joystick.

## Events

    event buttons_changed @ change {
        buttons: Buttons
    }

Emitted whenever the state of buttons changes.
