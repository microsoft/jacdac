## Registers

    ro pressed @ reading {
        repeats:
          index: u8
    }

The coordinate of the button currently pressed. Keys are zero-indexed from left to right, top to bottom:
``row = index / columns``, ``column = index % columns``.

    const rows: u8 @ 0x180

Number of rows in the matrix

    const columns: u8 @ 0x181

Number of columns in the matrix

    const labels? @ 0x182 {
        repeats:
            label: string0
    }

The characters printed on the keys if any, in indexing sequence.

    enum Variant: u8 {
        Membrane = 1
        Keyboard = 2
        Elastomer = 3
        ElastomerLEDPixel = 4
    }
    const variant?: Variant @ variant

The type of physical keypad. If the variant is ``ElastomerLEDPixel``
and the next service on the device is a ``LEDPixel`` service, it is considered
as the service controlling the LED pixel on the keypad.
