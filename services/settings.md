# Settings

    identifier: 0x1107dc4a
    camel: settings

Non-volatile key-value storage interface for storing settings.

## Secrets

Entries with keys starting with `$` are considered secret.
They can be written normally, but they read as a single `0` byte,
unless they are empty, in which case the value returned is also empty.
These are typically used by other services on the same device.
