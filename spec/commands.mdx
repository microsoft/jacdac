# Commands

Command codes are partitioned as follows:

* `0x0000-0x007f` - commands common to all services, defined in `jdprotocol.h`
* `0x0080-0x0eff` - commands defined per-service
* `0x0f00-0x0fff` - reserved for implementation, should not be used on wire
* `0x1000-0x1fff` - register read commands
* `0x2000-0x2fff` - register write commands
* `0x3000-0xffff` - reserved for future use

## Virtual registers

Devices can expose virtual registers.
Each register is logically between 1 bit and 236 bytes in size.
If register is written with a value shorter than register size, the
value is zero-extended or sign-extended depending on register.

Registers are identified by 12 bit indices, called register codes, and not memory addresses
and are non-overlapping.
For example, it's possible to have register `0x090` of size `12`
and non-overlapping register `0x091` of size `4`.

Register codes are partitioned as follows:

* `0x001-0x07f` - r/w common to all services
* `0x080-0x0ff` - r/w defined per-service
* `0x100-0x17f` - r/o common to all services
* `0x180-0x1ff` - r/o defined per-service
* `0x200-0xeff` - custom, defined per-service - best avoided
* `0xf00-0xfff` - reserved for implementation, should not be on the wire

To read register `0x023` send a command `0x1023`.
A `0x1023` report will contain the current value.
To write that register, send `0x2023` command.

## Registers vs commands

Client implementations should:
* before the client device is connected, queue up all commands
* when the client device enumerates, send all these commands
* when the client device re-attaches (eg., resets), all register-set commands (but not other commands) should be re-send
* when queuing up commands, only queue one instance per each command (including one instance per register)

These requirements can be used as guideline when to use a register vs a command
in a service design.

## Pipes

Pipes are application-level mechanism for establishing reliable one- and two-way 
point-to-point data links.

Typical packet loss in JACDAC networks is well under 1%.
Anything that can withstand such packet loss **should not** be done over a pipe,
as pipes have quite big overhead.

Typical applications where pipes should be used:
* a WiFi service, where the pipe represents a TCP connection
* when a response to a command doesn't fit in one packet (eg. WiFi scan results)
* when events need to be delivered reliably (eg., RFID reader)

Pipes should generally not be used for:
* streaming sensor data (sensor events are OK)
* video data
* audio data

The way to initially establish a pipe depends on service, but typically
device A would send a command to device B to establish a pipe.
Device A would include its device identifier and _port_
(a 9 bit number of A's choosing; there would normally be one port per pipe) in the command.
If a two-way communication is desired, device B could then state the port on its side.

Both devices can then start sending commands to their respective ports.
The pipe commands use a fixed service number of `0x3e` and set the require-ACK
flag on frames.
The service command is split as follows:

| Bits  | Description
|------:| ------------------------------------
|   4:0 | Wrap around packet counter
|   6:5 | Content type
|  15:7 | Port number

The packet counter starts at `0x0` goes up to `0x1f`, and then back to `0x0`.
Rationale: there can be up to 30 non-empty packets in a frame.

Content type is:
* `0` for regular pipe data
* `1` for regular pipe data after which the pipe is to be closed
* `2` for service-specific out-of-band meta-data
* `3` is reserved

The sending protocol is:
* wait for any data that needs to be sent over the pipe
* send it as a command; wait for ACK
* if we timeout waiting for ACK, repeat previous step
* if we repeated 10 times already, close the pipe
* increment the pipe counter
* go back to the first step

The wait for ACK should follow exponential back-off, starting with 1ms up to 1024ms.

The receiving protocol keeps a counter for each pipe. This counter starts at 0.
* when a pipe command is received, ACK it (this is usually done generically, not only for pipes)
* if stored counter for pipe doesn't match the counter in the packet, drop the packet
* increment stored counter
* process data in packet
* repeat

The protocol above has an effective window of 1.
The counter allows increasing that up to 31, but this would require dealing with 
multiple packets per frame and is currently out of scope.

Pipes should be considered closed when the device at the other end resets.

TODO: Zero-length pipe commands can be sent as keep-alive packets.
Is this needed? 

Note that pipes are transmit streams of JACDAC packets, not streams of bytes.
They should not be recombined at any layer in the implementation.
For example, a command that returns a list of things can send each thing in a separate
pipe packet, without any additional info about how to chunk the data
(provided each thing fits in a packet).
Multiple packets can be grouped in a frame, but are still handled separately at the
destination.

## Event subscriptions

A device like accelerometer can send events eg. when a 2g shock is detected,
when it's moved face-down, etc.
These events a normally just broadcast on the bus, using standard command `0x001`.

For reliable event delivery, a pipe can be established, and events delivered
over that pipe.
