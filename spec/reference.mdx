For a definition of JACDAC terms, see the [glossary](./glossary).

### For JACDAC users

JACDAC has support for the C, CircuitPython, and TypeScript languages, as well as for Microsoft MakeCode. To get familiar with the JACDAC abstractions, we suggest browsing the TypeScript [JACDAC Object Model](../clients/web/dom), which is used to make this web site a JACDAC endpoint (over WebUSB), as well as the [tools](../tools/) built using the model.

### For JACDAC device manufacturers and firmware engineers

You will want to read about adding a [device entry](./device-entry) to the [device catalog](../devices) and the role of [service specifications](./service-specification), found in the [service catalog](../services). Please read the [JACDAC protocol](./jacdac-protocol) to learn about the JACDAC packet structure and state machine. To port the JACDAC protocol to a new microcontroller requires implementing the [single wire serial (SWS) protocol](./sws-protocol), which requires that the microcontroller have UART, Timer, and GPIO interrupt capabilities.
