# Device Development Kit

The [Device Development Kit (DDK)](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk) is for 3rd party hardware designers, firmware developers and manufacturers who wish to create their own Jacdac devices.
A Jacdac device has at least the following three features:

-   it has a [Jacdac edge connector](/hardware/ddk/connector/) for joining the device to the Jacdac bus
    using [Jacdac cables](/hardware/ddk/connector/#cable);
-   it implements the [Jacdac protocol](/reference/protocol/) to communicate over the bus via the connector;
-   it follows the [design guidelines](/hardware/ddk/design/) in this DDK.

Additionally, Jacdac devices may supply power to the bus and/or consume power from the bus.

A common realization of a Jacdac device is a printed circuit board (PCB)
that includes a microcontroller unit (MCU) connected to a specific set of components including sensors,
actuators, network interfaces and/or power supplies.

## Jacdac Devices

Jacdac is a bus-based plug-and-play hardware and software stack for microcontrollers and their peripherals such as sensors and actuators.
Jacdac is primarily designed for “modular electronics” scenarios that support rapid prototyping, creative exploration, making and learning through physical computing.
Jacdac is designed to be cheap, flexible and extensible.

Architecturally, a key idea behind Jacdac is a separation of concerns between the worlds of _client_ code (applications) and _server_ firmware that interfaces with sensors/actuators.
The Jacdac protocol and services are abstractions that achieve this separation, creating a client/server architecture.
This architecture naturally results in the following categories of Jacdac devices:

### Brains

A Jacdac _brain_ is a Jacdac device that runs application/client code that makes use of services that are available on the Jacdac bus to achieve some end-user scenario.
A _dedicated_ Jacdac brain contains a re-programmable MCU and little else; it leverages Jacdac services for all its input and output.
An _integrated_ Jacdac brain combines an MCU with on-board input and output and can typically operate stand-alone;
in this case the Jacdac bus provides a way to add additional capabilities to the device.
An example integrated Jacdac brain would be a programmable robot base with built-in motors and
collision sensors that uses the Jacdac interface and protocol to support the connection of Jacdac modules
that provide new capabilities such as light and sound detection, a line following sensor, etc.

### Modules

A Jacdac _module_ can be thought of as a very small server that makes one or more sensors and/or actuators available to other Jacdac devices on the bus.
In the most straightforward implementation, a module is a small PCB that includes an MCU connected to an on-board sensor or actuator. The MCU firmware exposes this component via [services](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/) advertised over the Jacdac bus. What distinguishes a module from a Jacdac brain is that a module usually does not execute application code.

### Power supplies

The Jacdac bus supports power delivery in addition to communications. Jacdac devices may be designed to consume power from the bus, to provide power to the bus, to be independently powered, or to alternatve between these modes. Typically, Jacdac modules such as basic sensors and actuators will be bus-powered which makes them simple to design and to use. Jacdac brains may also be bus-powered, but in some cases they will be designed to be the power source for the Jacdac bus; a good example of this is the programmable robot base mentioned above. If none of the brains or modules on the bus provide power, or in scenarios where additional power is required, a _Jacdac power supply_ will be required and must be plugged into the bus.

### Adaptors, or "Jacdaptors"

Jacdac can provide a convenient way to add functionality to existing electronics prototyping platforms including micro:bit, Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
This requires suitable firmware to be developed and a physical layer adaptor that providing a suitable electrical interface to a Jacdac connector.
We call this a _Jacdaptor_.

A USB Jacdaptor allows a Jacdac bus to be connected to a laptop or desktop.
WebUSB allows browser-based applications to connect to the Jacdac bus.

## Key elements of the Jacdac DDK

### Jacdac modules

The Jacdac DDK supports 3rd party module development via the following steps:

1. choosing on-board components and incorporating them in a [hardware design](/hardware/ddk/design);
2. identifying the [services](/services/) to represent the chosen components;
3. building [firmware](/hardware/ddk/firmware) to expose the components on the Jacdac bus;
4. [validating](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/validation) the hardware;
5. [manufacturing](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/manufacture) the hardware;
6. [submitting](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/submission) the finalised device to the Jacdac catalog;

Our current Jacdac module hardware and firmware designs target the PADAUK 8-bit and STM32x0 32-bit families of MCUs.
STM32x0 support includes a Jacdac bootloader service that allows MCU firmware to be updated over Jacdac.
We strongly encourage you to take advantage of our hardware and firmware reference implementations to simplify the above steps.

### Other Jacdac devices

We will make hardware and firmware reference implementations of Jacdac brains,
Jacdac power supplies and Jacdaptors available in due course
at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk.
