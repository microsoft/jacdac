## User feedback

### Status LED

All Jacdac modules should have a status LED indicates [module and bus status](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/reference/led-status/) to the user. 
This can be a single colour orange LED or a three-colour RGB LED.

The status LED may be disabled by the user to reduce current consumption. 
RGB LEDs may also put into a mode where the colour is controlled by the user.

## Signalling

Data transmission occurs on JD_DATA using a single-wire half duplex asynchronous serial protocol we call Jacdac single wire serial (SWS). 
Data bytes are 10 bits long and are composed of 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. Jacdac devices must only communicate at 1 Mbaud and when no data is being transmitted, the bus must read as a logical one.

Many MCU UARTs support single-wire half duplex communications, but if necessesary the UART transmit and receive pins can be connected together externally.

For more details please refer to the [Single wire protocol section](/reference/protocol/#single-wire-serial-sws) 
of the [Jacdac protocol specification](/reference/protocol/).

The native Jacdac SWS signal uses 3.3V logic where a logial one is nominally 3.3V and a logical zero is nominally 0V.

To interface a microcontroller to the Jacdac bus data signal (JD_DATA) use the following circuit:
![Jacdac bus interface](Jacdac_electrical_interface.png)

In the above schematic, the ESD diodes protect against potential static discharges directly onto the Jacdac PCB edge connector. Many alternative ESD didoes are suitable but we require ultra-low capacitance. The low-pass filter formed by FB1, C1 and R1 reduces unwanted electromagnetic emissions. R1 also limits JD_DATA current, and D1 products the microcontroller in case of unexpected voltages on the bus.

Note that when power is shared over the Jacdac bus, current flowing between devices will result in voltage drops. The current is limited to 1A but there may be several potentially long cables between a power provider and a power consumer resulting in an end-to-end resistance of several hundred mΩ and hence a voltage drop of severl hundred mV in each direction (i.e. both on JD_PWR and on the GND return path).

## Power supply sharing

In addition to providing data communications, Jacdac supports the sharing of power between devices.

### Power supply sharing options

From a power perspective, Jacdac devices fall into one of four catgeories:

-   **Independently powered:** A device that communicates on the Jacdac bus without providing power or consuming power. It must have a bus independent power source of some kind – e.g. a battery or a USB-micro socket for external power – from which it operates.
-   **Pure power provider:** A pure power provider is a device that is capable of supplying power to the Jacdac bus. The current available to the bus must be limited by circuitry in the power provider, and power providers capable of supplying more than 100mA must contain an MCU that implements the Jacdac power provision service.
-   **Pure power consumer:** A power consumer always draws power from the Jacdac bus; the bus is its only power source. An absolute maximum current of 1A may be drawn from the bus, but due power provision tolerance a single module should draw no more than 900mA. If a device sometimes or always requires more than this it must be implemented as a power independent device or as a power provider.
-   **Dynamically powered device:** Some Jacdac devices may be able to operate as either a power consumer, power independent device and/or power provider. For example, a device with a bus independent power source may use that power source when it’s available but switch to using the Jacdac bus as a power source otherwise. We refer to these as dynamically powered Jacdac devices.

### Overview of Jacdac power sharing

The simplest Jacdac scenario involves a single power provider device connected directly to a pure power consumer device. An example is a [MakeCode Arcade gaming device](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware) connected to a Jacdac temperature sensor. The power provider will continuously deliver power to the Jacdac bus, and when the power consumer is connected it will power up and start signalling its presence. Any number of additional pure power consumers and/or power independent devices may be connected to the bus, as long as the power provider can deliver enough current to operate them all.

In order to provide a certain level of safety, the power available on the bus is limited. This means that all power providers (including dynamically powered devices) must limit the current they deliver to the bus. The side-effect of this current limiting means that if the aggregate load of power consumers on the bus cannot be met, the bus voltage will fall and device operation will become unreliable. Jacdac includes provision for user feedback that aims to make this condition easy to detect, understand and debug.

There are two types of power provider:

-   **Low current power providers** may supply up to 100mA at 5V, i.e. 0.5W. This may either be on a single PCB edge connector or shared across several PCB edge connectors.
-   **High current power providers** may supply up to 1A at 5V, i.e. 5W. High current hub providers may supply up to 1A per Jacdac PCB edge connector. High current Jacdac power providers must contain an MCU that implements the Jacdac power provision service which ensures that only one such provider is active at any one time. This limits the current available on any one part of the Jacdac bus to 1A.

By default Jacdac power providers are active (i.e. actively providing power) when they are first connected. This ensures that power is successfully delivered to pure power consumers. The Jacdac power provision service will quickly detect if more than one high current provider is active at the same time and will cause one to be disabled; most likely it will move into power independent operation but it could instead become a power consumer.

### Power provider current limiting

As mentioned above, power providers **must** incorporate current limiting. We recommend the use of one of the many readily-available low-cost single-chip current limiters that operate at up to 5.5V.

Current limiters specify a tolerance on their output current - please ensure that the **maximum** output current does not exceed 100mA or 1A (for low current and high current providers respectively). This often means settin the typical current to a value like 75mA or 900mA, which might result in as little as 50mA or 800mA in some cases. But it is important that the **maximum** current specification is not exceeded.

**Resettable polyfuses are not suitable** for current limiting because they have a relatively large 'on' resistance, a larger threshold current tolerance and do not switch on or off cleanly. This is very confusing for the user. You must use a silicon current limiter.

### Bus voltage range

The nominal 5V bus voltage and maximum 1A bus current limit allow commonly available USB power delivery parts to be used for Jacdac. In particular, 5V power adapters, 5V power packs, 5V current limiting ICs and 5V DC-DC converters are all commodity items. Note that high current providers do not have to provie 1A, it may for example be cheaper to implement a 500mA power provider.

Note that any current flowing through the Jacdac bus will result in a voltage drop between the points of power provision and consumption, and any ground return current will cause a similar voltage drop. For example, a 300mm single-hop cable will have up to 100mΩ resistance (including contact resistance at both ends), which at 1A results in a 100mV drop on JD_PWR between power provider and power consumer, and a 100mV 'rise' on the GND return path, i.e. the power consuming device sees 200mV less than is being provided at the source. Additional hubs and cables will further reduce the margin.

### Power consumers

A power consumer may draw an absolute maximum of 1A from the Jacdac bus, however we recommend a maximum consumption of 900mA given that 5W power providers may not consistently provide the full 1A.

To accomodate voltage drops, Jacdac devices must be capable of operating when the potential between JD_PWR and GND falls to 3.7V. Since we expect the logic of a Jacdac device to operate at 3.3V (or lower), a low dropout linear regulator is the cheapest and simplest way to regulate JD_PWR to power a device from the bus. Alternatively a DC-DC converter can be used for improved efficiency.

## Jacdac PCB edge connector

### PCB edge connector in detail

A PCB edge connector was chosen for Jacdac primarily because it is so cheap and easy to implement. The PCB must be 1.6mm ±10% thick from conductor to conductor at the point of the edge connector. It must use gold plated electrical contacts with at least 0.05μm (2μ") gold plating to ensure the contact resistance and mate/unmate cycle lifetime can be met. Electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) is acceptable. Thicker gold (e.g. 3μ") will increase the lifetime of the PCB edge connector.

The three electrical contacts are on 1.27mm (0.05”) pitch. The JD_DATA contact is shorter than the JD_PWR and GND contacts to ensure it is the last to make electrical contact. The PCB must be at least double sided, and the three electrical contacts must be present on both sides of the edge connector; this allows the mating connector to be attached either way up. The contacts on the top and bottom sides of the PCB must be connected electrically using traces and/or vias on the PCB. We provide footprints for some popular electronic CAD tools.

The mechanical mating and umating process relies on two small, unplated slots in the Jacdac PCB edge connector. These should be 0.7mm wide (±0.1mm), i.e. milled with a 0.7mm diameter router. In addition, three plated through-holes are required as part of the Jacdac PCB edge connector to support future extensions of the Jacdac specification. These must be 0.71mm diameter (+0.15/-0.05mm) after plating, with an annular ring of diameter 1.11mm (±0.1mm).

Please refer to the [technical drawing of the Jacdac PCB edge connector](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/blob/main/connector/JACDAC_PCB_Edge_Connector_Drawing_JD-PEC-02_rev_05.pdf) for full details. Note how the Jacdac electrical contacts are shorter on the bottom side of the PCB because they must not connect electrically to the adjacent plated through-holes.

[![Jacdac PCB edge connector technical drawing](../images/JACDAC_PCB_Edge_Connector_Drawing_JD-PEC-02_rev_05.png)](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/blob/main/connector/JACDAC_PCB_Edge_Connector_Drawing_JD-PEC-02_rev_05.pdf)

We provide Jacdac PCB edge connector libraries for some electronics CAD tools including Altium, Eagle and KiCAD [here](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/connector).

There are two optional improvements which provide a better connection. Electroplated 'hard gold' may be used instead of ENIG for the Jacdac contact, and this provides better durability. Also, the end of the Jacdac PCB edge connector can have a bevelled or chamfered edge of between 30° and 60°. This reduces the initial mating force required to attach the mating connector. The PCB manufacturers may require that this is specified manually as an annotation in the gerber files or as a note in a README file. Note that both of these features (hard gold and bevelled edges) are optional.

### Jacdac cable connectors and cable assemblies

A purpose-built cable connector is used to interface with the Jacdac PCB edge connector desribed above. The cable connector is reversible (i.e. it is 180° rotationally symmetric) but internally it only needs to have contacts on one side due to the double-sided design of the mating Jacdac PCB edge connector.

![Jacdac cable being unplugged and replugged animated image](../images/reversibleconnectoranimation.gif)

Together with the Jacdac PCB edge connector, the mating half must give a mating and unmating force of 5-15N and each of the three electrical connections it provides should have a contact resistance of 30 mΩ or less and a current capacity of 1A DC. These characteristics should be consistent for a lifetime of at least 1500 mate/unmate cycles.

Jacdac cable assemblies contain three conductors and are terminated at both ends with a Jacdac cable connector. The wiring is 'straight through' . i.e. it connects JD_DATA at one end to JD_DATA at the other, JD_PWR to JD_PWR and GND to GND. The conductors used for JD_PWR and GND must have a resistance of at most 135mΩ/m and capable of carrying a continuous DC current of 1A. This translate to 26AWG (e.g. 30/0.08) or thicker. We suggest an ultra-flexible insulator such as silicone or another thermpostic elastomer (TPE).

The first manufacturer of Jacdac cable connectors and cable assemblies is [Dongguan Yuliang Electronics](http://dgyuliang.net/) who are also known by their [Cylconn](http://www.cylconn.com/) brand.

## Multiple connectors

In the simplest configurations all devices on a Jacdac bus are connected directly to the three Jacdac signal wires. This is easy to achieve with just two devices - they are simply connected together using a single cable. Jacdac supports two mechanisms for connecting more than two devices to the same Jacdac bus:

-   **Daisy-chaining**: Jacdac devices may have a connector at each end of the PCB to enable end-to-end "daisy-chaining".
-   **Hub devices**: Jacdac devices may include several Jacdac PCB edge connectors to allow direct connection to more than two other devices.
-   **Decidated hubs**: Jacdac hubs are simply double-sided PCBs with mutiple Jacdac PCB edge connectors, wired to connect all JD_DATA signals together, all JD_PWR signals together and all GND signals together. They need contain no electronic components.

![several Jacdac modules connected together](../images/manymodulestogether.png)

## Mounting holes

Where Jacdac modules include mounting holes, we recommend that these be plated-through hole (PTH) and electrically connected to the Jacdac bus signals JD_PWR, JD_DATA and GND. This provides additional mechanisms for connecting modules together instead of the PCB edge connector, including the use of metal screws, threaded stand-off pillars, 'banana' style jack plugs and soldering.

If PTHs are used, we recommend the use of four holes, one in each 'corner' of the module. Two of these must be connected to the GND net, and the other two connected to JD_DATA and JD_PWR. We suggest that the latter two are located adjacent to the Jacdac PCB edge connector so that the traces that connect the PTH to the edge connector fingers can be short and therefore share a common ESD diode. If the JD_DATA and JD_PWR PTHs are more than 10-15mm from the PCB edge connector, we recommend additional ESD protection.

One of the two PTHs connected to GND should be designated as 'mounting hole 1' and have a silkscreen mark on the top layer of the board only to indicate this. See below.

We recommend the use of 3mm holes as per the spec below, although we have also found 2mm holes useful if a small module size is important. Many of our reference designs use 2mm holes.

### Four 3mm plated-through holes

Use holes with a finished diameter of 3.2mm, annular copper ring of 4.5mm diameter & copper/component keepout of 7.0mm. The keepout is necessary to ensure that screw heads and the bodies of standoffs do not interfere with any components on the PCB or short any traces near the hole.

The mounting holes must be on 5mm pitch. This allows the modules to be mounted on a pre-drilled/perforated plate that has holes every 5mm in each direction.

### Four 2mm plated-through holes

Use holes with a finished diameter of 2.1mm, annular copper ring of 3.0mm diameter & copper/component keepout of 5.0mm. The keepout is necessary to ensure that screw heads and the bodies of standoffs do not interfere with any components on the PCB or short any traces near the hole.

The mounting holes must be on 2.5mm pitch. This allows the modules to be mounted on a pre-drilled/perforated plate that has holes every 2.5mm in each direction.

# Mechanical

## Module labelling

All modules should include silkscreen that allows a user to easily and uniquely identify the module, and its version number.

Modules may optionally include a QR code printed on the silkscreen. The QR code should point to **short url** that redirects to the product information. If your device is registered, you can redirect to [Jacdac device catalog](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/) device page.

To generate the QR Code for various CAD programs, you can use the [Jacdac Device QR Code generator](/tools/device-qr-code/).

## Standard module sizes and shapes

To make it easier for users to recognize Jacdac modules and for manufacturers to design Jacdac modules, we provide guidelines for a small number of standard form factors.

### Cute form factor

Most of our module reference designs use what we call a 'cute' form factor: they are small and have rounded board edges with mounting holes often protruding from the board edge.

![Rendering of a cute-shaped single LED module](../images/jacdacsinglergbledmodule.png)

To keep module size as small as possible, the cute form factor uses four 2.1mm holes on a 2.5mm pitch and often components are mounted on both sides of the PCB.

### Enclosure-compatible form factor

We are also working on the specifications for an 'enclosure-compatible' module form factor. This is designed to make it easier to build cheap enclosures for individual modules, or for groups of modules that constitute a working device. This will use four 3.2mm holes, will have straight board edges, and will require a component keepout/clearance band around the board outline. Full details will be published in due course.

# Manufacturing

## Programming and testing

### Hack connect

The MCU can be programmed before being fitted to the device PCB, or can be programmed in-circuit. In the latter case we suggest the use of a [hack-connect](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/dbg#:~:text=Hack--,connect,-XS).
