## Device definition

The Jacdac project maintains a catalog of known [devices](/devices/)
in the https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac repository.
Any manufacturer of Jacdac device is encouraged to add their own _devices_
to the catalog following the instructions below.

## Catalog format

The device catalog is stored as JSON and JPEG images,
organized under the [Jacdac devices](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/devices) folder.
Each company may create a new folder for their devices (or multiple folders for product families).

### Device specification

A device is specified by a JSON file and an image file (see below).
The JSON schema is defined by the `jdspec.DeviceSpec` interface
in `jdspec.d.ts`.

**To register new devices, use the [device registration](/tools/device-registration/) editor.**

<RandomGenerator device={true} />

### Image

Each device file, (e.g. `mydevice.md`), should be accompanied by a JPEG picture of the device, (e.g. `mydevice.jpg`).

-   4:3 aspect ratio
-   at least size 1024x768
-   Bamboo background, picture from the top

-   example: [microsoft-jm](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/blob/main/devices/microsoft/research/jmanalogjoystick44v02.jpg)

## Firmware updates

Firmware updates can be hosted as **UF2 files** of GitHub repositories.
Upon detecting a device with the specified firmware identifier,
Jacdac will automatically query the device catalog for the firmware repository, and download the latest firmware.

-   example [jacdac-msr-modules releases](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-msr-modules/tree/main/dist)

The procedure runs as follows:

-   detect device on the bus
-   query firmware identifier register in the control service
-   identify device in device catalog
-   query latest release from GitHub in the listed repository (using [semver](https://semver.org/)), download the **firmware.uf2** asset
-   compare firmware version on device to latest firmware and notify user of available device

### Building your firmware

You can concatenate all your built firmwares into a single **.uf2** file, 
which should be named `firmware.uf2` when uploaded to an asset.
