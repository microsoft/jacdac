## Device definition

The Jacdac project maintains a catalog of known [devices](/devices/)
in the https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac repository. 
Any manufacturer of Jacdac device is encouraged to add their own *devices* to the catalog following the instructions below.

## Catalog format

The device catalog is stored as JSON and JPEG images, organized under the [Jacdac devices](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/devices) folder.
Each company may create a new folder for their devices (or multiple folders for product families).

### Device specification

A device is specified by a JSON file and an image file (see below).
The JSON schema is defined by the ``jdspec.DeviceSpec`` interface
in ``jdspec.d.ts``. To register new devices, use the [device registration](/tools/device-registration/) editor.

### Image

Each device file, (e.g. ``mydevice.md``), should be accompanied by a JPEG picture of the device, (e.g. ``mydevice.jpg``).
* 4:3 aspect ratio
* 650 pixels wide
* White background, picture from the top

* example: [microsoft-jm](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/devices/microsoft-jm)

## Firmware updates

Firmware updates can be hosted as **assets** on **releases** of GitHub repositories.
Upon detecting a device with the specified firmware identifier, 
Jacdac will automatically query the device catalog for the firmware repository, and download the latest firmware.

* example [jacdac-stm32x0 releases](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0/releases)

The procedure runs as follows:
* detect device on the bus
* query firmware identifier register in the control service
* identify device in device catalog
* query latest release from GitHub in the listed repository (using [semver](https://semver.org/)), download the **firmware.uf2** asset
* compare firmware version on device to latest firmware and notify user of available device

### Building your firmware

You can concatenate all your built firmwares into a single **.uf2** file, which should be named ``firmware.uf2`` when uploaded to an asset.
