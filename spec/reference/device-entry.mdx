## Device (Catalog) Entry

The JACDAC project maintains a catalog of known [devices](/devices)
in the https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac repository. 
Any manufacturer of JACDAC device is encouraged to add their own *device
entry* to the catalog following the instructions below.

## Catalog format

The device catalog is stored as markdown text files and JPEG images, organized under the [JACDAC devices](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/devices) folder.
Each company may create a new folder for their devices (or multiple folders for product families).

### Device entry format

A device entry is authored in a markdown format 

* example: [accelerometer](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/blob/main/devices/microsoft-jm/acc.md)

You can start from this template:

```
# NAME

DESCRIPTION

* services: SERVICE_CLASS*
* firmware: FIRMARE_ID*
* repo: REPO_URL
* link: HOME_URL
```

where 
* ``NAME`` is the name of the device
* ``DESCRIPTION`` is a short 1 sentence description
* ``SERVICE_CLASS*`` is a comma separated list of [service classes](/services) supported by this device (``0x...``)
* ``FIRMWARE_ID*`` are the unique firmware identifers for the device. Sometimes there can be more than one for different hardware
   revisions. The JACDAC tool will detect duplicates. Use the widget below to generate a *Random Firmware Identifier*.
* ``REPO_URL`` is the URL to the GitHub repository hosting the firmware binaries.
* ``HOME_URL`` is the device store/home page for users

<RandomGenerator firmware={true} />

### Common file ``_default.md``

The special file ``_default.md`` will be appended to all other markdown file in the folder. This is a useful file to add common information
such as repository url or link url.

* example: [_default.md](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/blob/main/devices/microsoft-jm/_default.md)

```
* repo: REPO_URL
* link: HOME_URL
```

### Image

Each device file, (e.g. ``mydevice.md``), should be accompanied by a JPEG picture of the device, (e.g. ``mydevice.jpg``).
* 4:3 aspect ratio
* 600 pixels wide
* White background, picture from the top

* example: [microsoft-jm](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/devices/microsoft-jm)

## Firmware updates

Firmware updates can be hosted as **assets** on **releases** of GitHub repositories.
Upon detecting a device with the specified firmware identifier, 
JACDAC will automatically query the device catalog for the firmware repository, and download the latest firmware.

* example [jacdac-stm32x0 releases](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0/releases)

The procedure runs as follows:
* detect device on the bus
* query firmware identifier register in the control service
* identify device in device catalog
* query latest release from GitHub in the listed repository (using [semver](https://semver.org/)), download the **firmware.uf2** asset
* compare firmware version on device to latest firmware and notify user of available device

### Building your firmware

You can concatenate all your built firmwares into a single **.uf2** file, which should be named ``firmware.uf2`` when uploaded to an asset.
