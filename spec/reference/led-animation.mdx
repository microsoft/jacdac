# LED Animation

JACDAC supports a simple encoding for basic LED animations. It is used in the [control service](/services/control)
``status_light`` register and also in the [led service](/services/led).

```
    rw status_light ... {
        repeats:
            hue: u8
            saturation: u8
            value: u8
            duration8: u8 8ms
    }
```

Specifies a status light animation sequence on a colored or monochrome LED.
``hue``, ``saturation``, ``value`` are the components of an HSV color
and ``duration8`` is the duration of transition to the next color in the array, in units of ``8ms``. Module with monochrome LED can ignore ``hue``, ``saturation`` and use ``value``. The animation is played in a loop.
Set the register to empty buffer to disable the animation.

* Design your animation using the [LED Animation designer](/tools/led-animation-designer).
