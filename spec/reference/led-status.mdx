# LED status

Jacdac modules typically have a status LED 
that is very useful to quickly troubleshoot them.
The sections below details the blinking patterns
and their associated states.

## Connected

When connected, all modules on the Jacdac bus do a short synchronized blink (50us) every 500ms.

This is the happy state, everything is working and communicating properly.

## Startup

On startup, the LED lights up at 100% for 270ms, then 5.9% for rest of 530ms, 
then goes into application that turns it on full for 200ms.

## Identify

When you ask a device to identify itself, it will start a blinking sequence 
50ms every 150ms (50 on, 100 off) seven times (i.e. for 1 second).

## Disconnected

When the device does not receive any Jacdac packet for some time, 
it enters the **disconnected** mode and blinks 5ms every 250ms.

* check that the cable is properly secured on your module
* check that the other modules are in connected mode as well


## Panic

If the firmware crashes, it will enter **panic** mode
and do a fast blink 70ms on, 70ms off - 30 times (4.2 seconds) before a reboot.

## Bootloader

Every 524ms it changes from 5.9% and 1.6% (i.e. 1 sec duty cycle)
