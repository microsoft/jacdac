# LED status

Jacdac modules typically have a status LED 
that is very useful to quickly troubleshoot them.
The sections below details the blinking patterns
and their associated states.

Some modules have color LEDs and some monochrome orange LEDs.
The color names in descriptions should be ignored when you are working with
a module with a monochrome LED.

## Connected to network

Jacdac modules do a barely visible, very short (~50us) green blink when they see
announce packets from any brain (client).
This happens every 500ms if you have one brain, and more often if you have more of them.
All modules blink at the same time.

This is the happy state, everything is working and communicating properly.

## Connected to brain

When the brain connects the device to its role manager, the device will blink green
quickly three times (75ms on, 75ms off).

If you want to see if brain connects to some device, restart the brain and see if the device
blinks green three times.

## Startup

On startup, modules with bootloader will glow blue for around 300ms,
and then green for another 300ms.

Devices without bootloader will glow green for around 300ms.

## Identify

When you ask a device to identify itself, it will start a blinking sequence
262ms on, 262ms off, four times (around 2 seconds), with the blue LED.

## Disconnected

When the device does not receive any Jacdac packet for some time, 
it enters the **disconnected** mode and glows red 1 second on, 1 second off.

* check that the cable is properly secured on your module
* check that the other modules are in connected mode as well

## Panic

If the firmware crashes, it will enter **panic** mode
and glow red, with short ~50ms breaks every ~500ms for ~5 seconds before reboot.

## Bootloader

Bootloader glows blue, and cycles between brighter and less bright versions of blue
around every 0.5 second.
