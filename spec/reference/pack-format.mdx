# Pack Format

Format strings are space-separated sequences of type descriptions.
All numbers are understood to be little endian.
The following type descriptions are supported:

* `u8`, `u16`, `u32` - unsigned, 1, 2, and 4 bytes long respectively
* `i8`, `i16`, `i32` - similar, but signed
* `b` - buffer until the end of input (has to be last)
* `s` - similar, but utf-8 encoded string
* `z` - NUL-terminated utf-8 string
* `b[10]` - 10 byte buffer (10 is just an example, here and below)
* `s[10]` - 10 byte utf-8 string; trailing NUL bytes (if any) are removed
* `x[10]` - 10 bytes of padding

There is one more token, `r:`. The type descriptions following it are repeated in order
until the input buffer is exhausted.
When unpacking, fields after `r:` are repeated as an array of tuples.

In case there's only a single field repeating,
it's also possible to append `[]` to its type, to get an array of values.
