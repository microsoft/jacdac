## Physical Layer

The responsibility of the physical layer is to send/receive a byte buffer (representing a JACDAC frame from the [transport layer](../transport-layer)) over a particular media. Currently, we have implemented:

- [Single Wire Serial](./sws) connects microcontrollers to each other using UART
- Web USB

Future implementations:

- Bluetooth
- Micro:bit radio
