## Service Layer

The way JACDAC devices share resources with other devices on the bus are through __services__. Services provide abstract, standardized interfaces that can be used to interact with physical hardware resources (e.g. an accelerometer) or pure virtual resources (e.g. the state of a video game). This abstraction brings plug-and-play dynamism to JACDAC so that devices with different hardware, but the same overall functionality, can replace one another without having to recompile user applications. For example, two different models of accelerometer hardware can replace each other because they share the same software interface.

Services act on __commands__ and optionally respond with __reports__. Reports can also be emitted separately from a service without prompting from another device. This interface is specified in a [custom markdown language](../../service-specification) that lists the possible commands and reports that a service can consume and emit. Specifications can also inherit from other specifications. An example of this can be seen in the [sensor specification](../../../services/_sensor). JACDAC sensors inherit commands and reports from this specification, creating a set of base functionality for _all_ sensors.

A service is globally and uniquely identified by its service class, which should be found in the [service catalog](../../../services). For example, the service class of the [button service](../../../services/button) is `0x1473a263`, as specified in the button's [service specification](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/blob/main/services/button.md) in the GitHub repository that contains the registered services. (In contrast, the `service_index` field in the JACDAC packet is an index into the list of services advertised by a device. The control service has both service class 0 and service number 0.)

### Commands

Commands are 16-bit and specified in the `service_command` field of a JACDAC packet. A command is composed of a 4-bit operation and a 12-bit code.

The operation is stored in the top most nibble of the `service_command` field. The following table below outlines all possible operations; XXX represents any 12-bit command code:

| Operation number | Command 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x0XXX` | Action	|
| `0x1XXX` | Register read	|
| `0x2XXX` | Register write	|
| `0x3XXX`- `0x7XXX` | Reserved	|
| `0x8XXX`- `0xfXXX` | Events	|

#### Actions

Actions are a type of command that cause a service to begin to carry out a task. An example action might be to calibrate a magnetometer.

Services can freely allocate their own action command codes in the following range:

| Action code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x080-0xeff` | Service defined action command codes 	|

However, services __must not__ allocate any of the common or reserved action command codes specified in the table below:

| Action code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x000-0x07f` | Common action command codes	|
| `0xf00-0xfff` | Reserved action command codes	|

Common action command codes are allocated in the [system specification](../../../services/_system).

#### Registers

Registers are properties that represent the state of a service.  Registers are variable length and are between 1 byte and 236 bytes (max payload) in size. Sequential register codes do not overlap with one another. For example, it is possible to have register `0x090` of size `12` and non-overlapping register `0x091` of size `4`.

Registers can be accessed and modified by register read (`0x1XXX`) and register write (`0x2XXX`) operations. Registers can be specified to be read-only or read-write capable. Trying to write to a read-only register will result in a nop (no operation). Because registers can have different access attributes they are segmented into different command code ranges.

Register command codes can be freely allocated in the following ranges:

| Register code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x080-0x0ff` | Read-write register codes specific to a service	|
| `0x180-0x1ff` | Read-only register codes specific to a service	|
| `0x280-0x2ff` | Additional register codes specific to a service. Should generally be avoided.	|

However, services __must not__ allocate any of the common or reserved register command codes specified in the table below:

| Register code range | Purpose 	|
|--------|------------	|
| `0x001-0x07f` | Read-write registers common to all services	|
| `0x100-0x17f` | Read-only registers common to all services	|
| `0xf00-0xfff` | Reserved for future use.	|

Common register command codes are allocated in the [system specification](../../../services/_system).

#### Reports

Reports are packets sent by a service as a response to a command. They can also be used to independently broadcast important information such as events.

The layout of a report depends on its purpose:
*  __Register reports__ must always contain the register values requested in the original command packet, but for actions, the format is left up to the service creator to define.
* __Actions reports__ can either contain a pre-determined number of bytes as defined in the service specification or bear no operation.

A third type of report is an __Event__. Events are emitted independently by a service without prompting. Some services may offer an interface to configure which events are emitted.

Events have a specially-constructed operation code:
| Bits | Function 
|------|----------------------
| 15   | Always set for events
| 14:8 | Sequential counter
| 7:0  | Event code

Event codes `0x00-0x7f` are common to all services, and codes `0x80-0xff` are service-specific.
Events can (but often don't) contain payloads.

Event reports are sent in the same way as any other packet, and `device_identifier`, `service_index`, and `service_command` differentiate it from other types of reports. These differentiators provide a unique namespace for each service. Multiple event reports can be sent by using multiple packets in the same frame.

The counter in operation code is incremented by 1 for every event emitted.
This is global to device, not per-service.
Every event is typically emitted 3 times:
* once when it happens
* the first repetition after about 20ms
* the second repetition after about 100ms

Each repetition is emitted with the same sequential counter.

The client should ignore the repetitions it receives.
However, if the client misses an event, it will likely get the repetition, and handle that.
The client should maintain the last sequential number for every device.
If an event `X` comes with a sequential number in advance of what's expected, the client should drop it,
wait for the preceding event(s), and eventually handle the repetition of `X` when it arrives.
The client thus handles events in sequential order.

As a motivation, consider a device with button services.
If these are handled purely through events, the client will maintain the pressed state for each button.
For this, it's critical not to swap order of up/down events.
To recognize button combinations, it's important not to swap order of events from the two services.


### The control service

Each device runs its own control service, which emits advertisement packets roughly every 500 milliseconds. The service class of the control service is zero (0). Each advertisement contains the device's identifier (as usual) as well a list of host services offered by the device; other devices on the bus can inspect these advertisements and subsequently communicate with the advertised services to incorporate them in user applications.

The control service also offers a set of common commands that can be used to query/inspect each JACDAC device. For example, the `IDENTIFY` command causes a JACDAC device to perform an action that allows a user to locate a particular device, usually through blinking an LED. In addition to emiting an advertisement packet every 500 milliseconds, a device that hosts one or more services must respond to all commands listed in the [control service specification](../../../services/control).

The implementation complexity of the control service scales with respect to the number of services a device implements. For instance, it is very simple to process packets for a single user service (in addition to the control service), but complexity increases as more services are added. This flexibility is a benefit as it allows ultra low-cost microcontrollers to be used in simple devices.
