## Service Specification

A service specification describes the three main types of Jacdac packets that a service recognizes: registers, commands, and events.  

Service specifications are written in a literate form of markdown, for consumption by both human and machine. The formal specification fragments, given as markdown code sections, are interleaved with English specification text. The code sections can be in triple backticks or with four (4) leading spaces (examples in this document only use the leading spaces form).

```info
Use the [service editor](/tools/service-editor/) to create service specifications.
```

The [jdspectool](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/tree/main/spectool) takes a service specification in markdown format and converts it to JSON.
It can then also generate template files for implementation in various languages.



## Rocket Example

Here's a simple example:

```markdown
# Rocket engine

    identifier: 0x17d50e4b

A controller for a liquid-propelled rocket.
```

The first line (header) specifies the name of the service (`name` in JSON format). We then assign the service a unique identifier (`classIdentifier` in JSON format) and give a single line description of the service.
These identifers are always of the form `0x1-------`.
If you're just defining a new service, you can use the random generator below or specify it as `1` or other invalid value
and the jdspectool will suggest a valid random identifier.

<RandomGenerator device={false} />

What follows is a short description of the service (`notes["short"]` in JSON).

```markdown
## History

The idea of liquid rocket first appears in a book by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.
This type of rockets carried humans to the moon in Apollo 11.
```

Further non-normative sections can follow, which are stored in `notes["long"]` in JSON.

### Rocket Registers

```markdown
## Registers

All register writes incur 1.25ms delay.

    rw oxygen_delay = 100: u16 ms @ 0x80

The time to wait after starting hydrogen flow, before starting oxygen flow.

    ro core_temperature: u32 K @ 0x180

The temperature at engine core.

    const num_nozzles: u8 @ 0x181

The number of exhaust nozzles in this rocket.

    ro acceleration @ 0x182 {
        x: i16.16 m/s2
        y: i16.16 m/s2
        z: i16.16 m/s2
    }

Current acceleration forces experienced by the rocket.

    rw max_acceleration?: u16.16 @ 0x183

Read or configure the sensitivity of the sensor. (optional).
```

The first line of the registers section goes in `notes["registers"]` in JSON,
and is meant to be displayed along with every register description in various UIs.

The first register we define (`oxygen_delay`) can be read and written. When the device restarts, its value is `100` (default values are
typically `0` and in that case are not specified).
The value is unsigned and 16 bit long, and is expressed in milliseconds.
The register code is `0x80` (code ranges are specified in `_system.md`).
The text after the register definition ends up in `description` field in JSON.
Neither the register name (nor description) is ever sent over wire (the same applies to commands and events).

The next line specifies a read-only register (`core_temperature`), giving the current temperature in degrees Kelvin. A 32 bit value is used to avoid overflows.

The third register (`num_nozzles`) is unit-less and constant, at least until the device resets
(in the case of this service, the reset is usually quite spectacular).

The fourth register is current acceleration.
The `i16.16` type is signed 32 bit integer, where the value is shifted by 16 bits.
That is, the last 16 bits is the fractional part.
Similarly, a `i22.10` would also be a 32 bit integer, where the value is shifted by 10 bits.

The register also has three fields.
In fact, the `core_temperature` could be also expressed using the more verbose syntax,
using `_` as the field name:

```
ro core_temperature @ 0x180 {
    _: u32 K
}
```

The last register, `max_acceleration`, that specifies the sensitivity of the sensor, is optional.
This is denoted by adding a `?` after the register name.

You can specify a preferred interval for refreshing the register in the specification
as for the ``mcu_temperature`` register in the control service.

```
ro mcu_temperature?: i16 Â°C { preferred_interval=60000, typical_min = -10, typical_max = 150 } @ 0x182
```

### Pack Format

Format strings are space-separated sequences of type descriptions.
All numbers are understood to be little endian.
The following type descriptions are supported:

* `u8`, `u16`, `u32` - unsigned, 1, 2, and 4 bytes long respectively
* `i8`, `i16`, `i32` - similar, but signed
* `b` - buffer until the end of input (has to be last)
* `s` - similar, but utf-8 encoded string
* `z` - NULL-terminated utf-8 string
* `b[10]` - 10 byte buffer (10 is just an example, here and below)
* `s[10]` - 10 byte utf-8 string; trailing NUL bytes (if any) are removed
* `x[10]` - 10 bytes of padding

There is one more token, `r:`. The type descriptions following it are repeated in order
until the input buffer is exhausted.
When unpacking, fields after `r:` are repeated as an array of tuples.

In case there's only a single field repeating,
it's also possible to append `[]` to its type, to get an array of values.

### Rocket Commands

```markdown
## Commands

    command launch @ 0x80 {
        launch_secret_code: u32
        delay: u32 ms { absolute_min = 1000, absolute_max = 3_600_000 }
    }
    report {
        launch_id: u32;
    }

Fire up the rocket after `delay` ms. A correct launch code has to be provided.

    command abort @ 0x81 {
        launch_id: u32
    }

Cancel previously scheduled launch.

    command self_destroy @ 0x82 { }

Boom!
```

Here, no `note["commands"]` is provided (if it were, it would be used similar to `note["registers"]`).
The first command is used to initiate the launch sequence.
The controller will respond with a number identifier for this particular launch, which
can be used to abort it with the second command.

The `delay` is constrained to always be in range of 1 second to 1 hour.
Numbers can include underscores for readability.
Other possible constraints include `typical_min` and `typical_max`.
Constraints can be also applied on registers.

Note that `report` syntax skips name and command code - these are copied from the preceding
`command`.

Also note that `0x80` command code is used, which is the same as the register code for 
`oxygen_delay`.
This is allowed, as register codes occupy a separate namespace from command codes -
register codes combined with masks of `0x1000` or `0x2000` form command codes
for getting or setting registers.
Again, `_system.md` has ranges for allowed command codes.

The next command doesn't have an associated report.
The sender can still ask for an ACK.
It could have been equivalently specified with the short form as:

```
command abort: u32 @ 0x81
```

However, that would miss the informative field name `launch_id`.

Finally, some commands don't need arguments, like the `self_destroy` one.
The empty braces `{ }` can also be skipped.

### Rocket Events

```markdown
## Events

    event take_off @ 0x80

Rockets leaves the launch pad.

    event bird_in_nozzle @ 0x81 {
        nozzle_id: u8
    }

Indicates that nozzle is about to fail because of a forign object.
```

The address space for events is separate from commands and registers.
The range for user events is `0x80-0xff`.

Many events have no arguments, like the `take_off` one.
Arguments can be specified as for registers and commands.

## Extending specs

Service specs can extend certain base specs.
Currently, this mostly applies to `_sensor.md` spec.
For example:

```markdown
# Button

    identifier: 0x1473a263
    extends: _sensor

A simple push-button.

## Registers

    ro pressed: bool @ reading

Indicates whether the button is currently active (pressed).

## Events

    event down @ active

Emitted when button goes from inactive (`pressed == 0`) to active.

    event up @ inactive

Emitted when button goes from active (`pressed == 1`) to inactive.
```

All registers from the `_sensor.md` will be included (meaning `stream_samples` and `streaming_interval`).
Similarly, all commands and events would be included (but there are none).

The address of `pressed` register is specified as `@ reading`, meaning the address of the `reading` register in `_system.md`.
Services cannot extend `_system.md`, because it includes a large number of packets that are
never all present at the same time in a regular service.
All services implicitly extend `_base.md` though.
However, the names of these packets can be used in place of addresses.
In fact, this is the only way to refer to the addresses in the system range:
if the example used `@ 0x101` instead of `@ reading`, the jdspectool would generate an error.

## Other features

### High codes

The jdspectool validates ranges of commands and register addresses.
If you want to use high commands or registers (above 0x100/0x200; note that for vast majority
of services this should not be needed),
include `high: 1` after `identifier: ...` (the error message will tell you that).

### Repeats

Sometimes a packet contains an array of structs.
Often, this is preceded by a header.
Such a format can be expressed using `repeats:` label, as in the following example:

```markdown
    command set_throttle @ 0x83 {
        delay: u16 ms
    repeats:
        nozzle_id: u8
        throttle: u0.8 /
    }

Set throttle on specific nozzles, after specified delay.
```

The format of the packet is a single `u16`, followed by any number of pairs of `u8`.
The number of elements is determined by the size of the packet.
A simple `u32` array can be expressed as:

```markdown
    register side_illumination @ 0x80 {
    repeats:
        brightness: u32
    }

Set brightness level on side lamps. Number of lamps depends on the rocket.
```

### Units

Any data field should be annoted with its unit, to allow better interpretation of the data.

<SpecificationUnitList />

### Pipes

Pipes are an application-level mechanism for establishing reliable one- and two-way point-to-point data links.

Typical applications where pipes should be used:
* a WiFi service, where the pipe represents a TCP connection
* when a response to a command doesn't fit in one packet (eg. WiFi scan results)

Pipes are typically established using commands and reports.
The sink of the pipe needs to provide its device identifier (if not already present elsewhere) and a port number.
For example:

```markdown
    command get_logs @ 0x84 {
        results: pipe
    }

Ask for all stored logs.

    pipe report log_entry {
        timestamp: u32 ms
        text: string
    }

A single log entry.
```

Here, the `get_logs` command includes information where to send results - the type `pipe` is built-in and
consists of 8 byte device identifier, 2 byte port and 2 bytes of padding (should be sent as zero).
The device identifier in `pipe` will be set to the device asking for logs (the packet device identifer will be
set to the rocket identifier).
The port number is also allocated on the device asking for logs.
The logs are then sent, one entry per packet.
Once all logs are sent, the pipe is closed by the rocket.
A command like `monitor_logs` could leave the pipe open, and keep sending new log entries.

You will notice that `pipe report` doesn't have a code assigned.
If you need several different types of reports going over a single pipe,
you can use `meta pipe report`:

```markdown
    meta pipe report log_progress @ 0x01 {
        sent_entries: u32
        total_entries: u32
    }

Sent while the logs are streaming to indicate progress.
```

The pipe packets in specification always refer to the most recent command or report.
There can be only one `pipe report`, but multiple `meta pipe report` entries
per pipe-opening command.

In addition to pipe reports, pipe commands are also possible.

```markdown
    command set_certificate @ 0x85 {
        certificate_name: string
    }
    report {
        cert_port: pipe_port
    }

Start certificate update process for the named certificate.

    pipe command certificate_part {
    segmented:
        x509: bytes
    }

A fragment of certificate to update.
```

Here the `set_certificate` command responds with a port where the certificate (which can be larger than 236 bytes) can be sent.
`pipe_port` is stored as `u16` (device identifier is taken from the packet itself).
Once we have the port number, we can start sending the certificate to the rocket.
The certificate is split arbitrarily and sent segment by segment.
The `segmented:` annotation indicates that the payloads of pipe commands should be concatenated together,
and not treated as separate entries.

A command, for example one that opens a TCP connection, can include `pipe` while its report also includes `pipe_port`.
Then we have separate `pipe command` and `pipe report` packet description below.
`meta pipe command` is analogous to `meta pipe report`.

If a command needs to return multiple large objects, you can use `multi-segmented:` instead of `segmented:`.
The interpretation is that each object is segmented as usual,
and a zero-length packet is sent between each two objects.
The final zero-length packet, before closing the pipe, is optional.

Both `segmented:` and `multi-segmented:` are currently only supported in `pipe report` and `pipe command`,
with a single field of type `bytes`.
