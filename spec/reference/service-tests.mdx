## Service Tests

A service test is a markdown file that contains a number of unit tests for a
given service. 

```info
Use the [service test editor](/tools/service-test-editor/) to
view, create and edit tests.
```

The unit tests can be a mixture of automated and manual tests.
A simple domain-specific set of test constructs is made available for easy
authoring of tests for the common cases, with an escape hatch to write TypeScript
for more complex test scenarios.

The markdown file can (optionally) have a header (#) with a descriptive title. Each unit
test must with a subheader (##) with a unique short description. A test
generally starts with a prompt to the user, specified in markdown, followed by 
a sequence of test commands. 

## Test commands

A test command is a single line JavaScript function call, indented. We currently
support the following calls:

- **ask**(): ask the user to give a Yes/No answer to the question specified in preceding markdown
- **check**(*expr*): check if the *expr* evaluates true (can make use of the **start** test expression)
- **changes**(*expr*): check if the *expr* changes
- **increases**(*register*): check if *register* increases in value
- **decreases**(*register*): check if *register* decreases in value
- **increasesBy**(*register*,*expr*): check if *register* increases in value by *expr*
- **decreasesBy**(*register*,*expr*): check if *register* decreases in value by *expr*
- **rangesFromUpTo**(*register*,*startExpr*,*endExpr*): check if register increases from startExpr to endExpr (and integer values in between)
- **rangesFromDownTo**(*register*,*startExpr*,*endExpr*): check if register decreases from startExpr to endExpr (and integer values in between
- **reset**(): send reset command to device

## Test expressions

Most test expressions are just JavaScript expressions where identifiers 
refer to elements of the service specification (e.g., registers). A few 
special test functions are provided:
- **start**(*expr*): the value of *expr* just before execution of the **check** test command, multiple **start** subexpressions can be used within a **check** expression
