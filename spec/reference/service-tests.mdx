## Service Tests

A service test is a markdown file that contains a number of unit tests for a
given service.  The unit tests can be a mixture of automated and manual tests.
A simple domain-specific set of test constructs is made available for easy
author of tests for the common cases, with an escape hatch to write TypeScript
for more complex test scenarios.
