## Service Tests

A service test is a markdown file that contains a number of unit tests for a
given service. 

* Use the [service test dashboard](/tools/service-test/) to run tests on devices. 
* Use the [service test editor](/tools/service-test-editor/) to
view, create and edit tests.

The unit tests can be a mixture of automated and manual tests.
A simple domain-specific set of test constructs is made available for easy
authoring of tests for the common cases, with an escape hatch to write TypeScript
for more complex test scenarios.

The markdown file can (optionally) have a header (#) with a descriptive title. Each unit
test must with a subheader (##) with a unique short description. A test
generally starts with a prompt to the user, specified in markdown, followed by 
a sequence of test commands. 

## Test commands

A test command is a single line JavaScript function call, indented. Most expressions are just JavaScript expressions where identifiers 
refer to elements of the service specification (e.g., registers, events). We currently
support the following calls:

- **ask**(): ask the user to give a Yes/No answer to the question specified in preceding markdown
- **check**(*expr*): check if the *expr* evaluates true; the expression can refer to registers and can make use of the **start** test expression;
- **changes**(*expr*): check if the *expr* changes

### registers

- **assign**(*register*,*expr*): assigns the value of *expr* to *register*
- **increases**(*register*): check if *register* increases in value
- **decreases**(*register*): check if *register* decreases in value
- **increasesBy**(*register*,*expr*): check if *register* increases in value by at least *expr*
- **decreasesBy**(*register*,*expr*): check if *register* decreases in value by at least *expr*
- **stepsUpTo**(*register*,*startExpr*,*endExpr*): check if register increases from startExpr to endExpr (and integer values in between)
- **stepsDownTo**(*register*,*startExpr*,*endExpr*): check if register decreases from startExpr to endExpr (and integer values in between

### events

- **awaitEvent**(*event*,*expr*): wait for the *event* to arrive (ignoring other events) and then check the optional *expr* (which may refer to arguments of *event*)
- **nextEvent**(*event*,*expr*): next event should be *event* (fail if other events), and then check the optional *expr* (which may refer to arguments of *event*)
- **events**([*event1*, *event2*...]): checks for the given sequence of events. This is shorthand for `nextEvent(event1,true); nextEvent(event2,true) ...`

## Test expressions

A few  special test functions are provided:

- **start**(*expr*): the value of *expr* just before execution of the **check** test command, multiple **start** subexpressions can be used within a **check** expression
- **closeTo**(*expr*, *goal*, *error*): waits until the value *expr* is between *goal - error* and *goal + error*, 
where the values of *goal* and *error* are captured at the start of the functione execution. This test expression can also be used
as a command.
