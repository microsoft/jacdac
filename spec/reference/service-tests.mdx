## Service Tests

A service test is a markdown file that contains a number of unit tests for a
given service. 

```info
Use the [service test editor](/tools/service-test-editor/) to
view, create and edit tests.
```

The unit tests can be a mixture of automated and manual tests.
A simple domain-specific set of test constructs is made available for easy
authoring of tests for the common cases, with an escape hatch to write TypeScript
for more complex test scenarios.

The markdown file can (optionally) have a header (#) with a descriptive title. Each unit
test must with a subheader (##) with a unique short description. A manual test
generally starts with a prompt to the user, followed by a sequence of test
commands. 

## Test commands

A test command is a single line JavaScript function call, indented. We currently
support the following calls.  Every call can have optional preceding markdown, which 
should be separated by a blank line from the call. The following two test functions
make use of this markdown in order to interact with the user for manual testing:

- **say**(): prompt the user with the preceding markdown
- **ask**(): ask the user to give a Yes/No answer to the question specified in preceding markdown

The remaining test functions can be checked automatically with a manual fallback

- **check**(*expr*): check if the *expr* evaluates true
- **changes**(*expr*): check if the *expr* changes
- **increases**(*register*): check if *register* increases in value
- **decreases**(*register*): check if *register* descreases in value
- **increasesBy**(*register*,*expr*): check if *register* increases in value by *expr*
- **decreasesBy**(*register*,*expr*): check if *register* descreases in value by *expr*
- **rangesFromUpTo**(*register*,*startExpr*,*endExpr*): check if register increases from startExpr to endExpr (and integer values in between)
- **rangesFromDownTo**(*register*,*startExpr*,*endExpr*): check if register decreases from startExpr to endExpr (and integer values in between
- **reset**()

## Test expressions

Most test expressions are just JavaScript expressions where identifiers 
refer to elements of the service specification (e.g., registers). A few 
special test functions are provided:
- **start**(expr): the value of expr at the start of the unit test
